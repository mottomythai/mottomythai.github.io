Hi, I'm Thai. I'm currently a Cyber Security student with a goal to become a Red Team Operator and a Bug Bounty Hunter.

*No*, this blog isn't about solving relationship problems. Instead, I would like to solve CTF problems.

**Red-Flagged** is my personal blog that focuses on cyber security and technology. It features a collection of CTF write-ups, bug bounty reports and personal opinions on the latest news. This website also serves as my personal portfolio, showcasing various projects alongside my r√©sum√©. I hope to use this platform to demonstrate my cyber security career journey and my passion for technology.

For contact information, you can connect with me via [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/to/thai-to), [GitHub](https://github.com/mottomythai) and my [email](mailto:thaito.work@gmail.com).

I'm currently open to any job offers, please visit my [r√©sum√©](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vxhw1l0syX03XPGe_v1zm3yDYfafq2XN/view?usp=share_link) and my [portfolio](https://mottomythai.github.io/posts/portfolio) for a better view on my works.

Enjoy while visiting my blog, and aware the red flags üòà
